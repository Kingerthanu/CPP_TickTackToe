# CPP_TickTackToe

Hardcore 1v1 game vs a AI Bot which actually is kinda cranked. To restart reopen window as I never came around to patching up some of the other details of this and kinda did it randomly during a carride. Fun stuff, but a little janky.

 The bot (Bob) will go first every time and tries finding the most optimal placement in order to beat you so watch out.
